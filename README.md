<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The purpose of the Employment Management System is to provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee information, making it suitable for a range of small to medium-sized businesses and organizations that require a simple and cost-effective solution for HR management. 

### Built With
* VS Code
* Python

### Features
The application uses Python variables, input/output functions, selection, and repetition control structures to create a functional application that allows users to add, view, search, update, export, and import employee information. 
* Add New Employee: Allows users to input information for a new employee, including name, SSN(Social Security Number), phone number, email, and salary. The information is then stored in memory.
* View All Employees: Displays the details of all employees currently stored in the system in a formatted manner.
* Search Employee by SSN: Enables end user to search for an employee by providing their SSN. If found, the employee's details are displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that the employee was not found is shown.
* Update Employee Information: Allows user to update the information of an employee by searching for them using their SSN. If the employee is found, users can confirm whether they want to update the displayed employee information. If confirmed, users can enter the new information, including the name, phone number, email, and salary.
* Export Employees' Information Into a Text File: Writes the information of all employees currently stored in the system to a text file named "employee.txt" located outside the project folder.
* Import Employees' Information From a Text File: Reads employee information from an external file named "employee.txt" and populates the system with this data.
* Exit Application: Terminates the program.
